# System Usage Guide 📝
## Upload the Code 🔄
* Open the Arduino IDE.
* Upload the selected code from the available versions on Arduino (further details below).

## Start 🚀
* Power the system through the USB-C port.
* Connect the system connector to the one installed on the GBA.
* Turn on the system.

## If using the version with LCD display 🖥️
* Adjust brightness by clicking the button.
* Once you’ve selected the desired brightness, hold the button down for more than 2 seconds and then release it.
* Use the potentiometer to set the timer. The potentiometer can increase or decrease the timer by one, ten, one hundred, or one thousand units, depending on the direction of rotation.
* After setting the timer, click the button.
* The GBA will automatically restart after 5 seconds.
* When the set time is up, Arduino will press the A button on the GBA.
* Reset the system by powering off and on Arduino.

## If using the version without LCD display 👀
This version requires a PC.
* Open the `NoDisplayMaxOptimized.ino` code with Arduino IDE.
* In line 2, change the `value` field to set the desired time for the timer.
* Connect Arduino to the GBA via the connector.
* Connect Arduino to the PC.
* If off, turn Arduino on via the button.
* Upload the code to Arduino.
* Arduino will automatically restart the GBA after 5 seconds.
* When the time set in `value` expires, Arduino will press the A button.
* Reset the system by powering off and on Arduino.

## Differences Between the three Code Versions 🆚
Three code versions are available:
* `CompleteCode.ino`: Includes all features, such as the LCD panel and real-time timer progress updates.
* `OptimizedCode.ino`: Includes the LCD panel but is optimized to reduce timer lag by dedicating all resources to timer control, without calculating progress percentage.
* `NoDisplay.ino`: Excludes the LCD display, potentiometer, and button, requiring a PC for use.

`OptimizedCode.ino` and `NoDisplay.ino` provide the same performance.
In `CompleteCode.ino`, performance is still considered, as the remaining percentage is updated only once every 5 seconds, and only if there are at least 10 seconds left, allowing for the best possible precision.

## Considerations about the code
The system must be restarted every time after the timer because I've used the `micros` function that overflow after around 70 minutes. To avoid problems I choos this approach

# Details 🔎
This document does NOT cover RNG manipulation techniques on GBA but presents a system to automate the RNG manipulation process on GBA.  
The goal is to create a system usable without a PC. Refer to the accompanying video for additional step-by-step details.

# Guide 🧭
## Modifying the GBA 🛠️
In this example, a Game Boy Advance SP is used.
I recommend following the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go9e5wqC74Q) for all the details and using this guide for code references or for an overview of the project.

### Step One 1️⃣
Solder thin wires onto the pins highlighted in the image. [Video for details](https://youtu.be/LYbvFizmgOc?si=4nlweEES0AOSoRyo&t=297)

<img src="../../Images/gbaSpMotherboard.png" alt="gbamother" width="500">

### Step Two 2️⃣
Drill the shell.
You can use a pre-modified shell with a hole on the right side.

<img src="../../Images/shell.png" alt="shell" width="500">

The goal is to guide the newly soldered wires out of the shell. Choose the best spot according to your needs. [Video for details](https://youtu.be/LYbvFizmgOc?si=U2tAdF9u9yge6Rqz&t=344)

### Step Three 3️⃣
Reassemble the GBA SP. [Video for details](https://youtu.be/LYbvFizmgOc?si=co-ZYWx3jPB3q41W&t=473)

## Building the Circuit ⚡
Follow the wiring diagram to create the circuit. [Video for details](https://youtu.be/LYbvFizmgOc?si=nMbl5dTbhvIPqXga&t=812)

<img src="../../Images/circuit.png" alt="circuit" width="500">

A USB-C extension with a button is recommended to interrupt power, allowing Arduino to be powered and reprogrammed even after assembly. [Video for details](https://youtu.be/LYbvFizmgOc?si=zW4mFCezqnHYHnvz&t=1474)
Many portable batteries stop charging if the load is too low, so a resistor in parallel to Arduino is added to enable power from portable batteries. There are more efficient solutions, but this is the simplest and most practical. [Video for details](https://youtu.be/LYbvFizmgOc?si=GJT893XRXDBKK_TV&t=1539)

### Circuit without LCD Display, Potentiometer, and Button ⚡👀
Use the `NoDisplay.ino` code with this wiring diagram.

## Printing and Assembling the Enclosure 📐
This was my first experience designing and printing an enclosure for a circuit, and there is certainly room for more compactness and optimization.
[This enclosure](../../3dFiles/) is designed for the complete version of the circuit.
Print the 3D file, choose points for drilling holes for the button, input USB-C port, and GBA connector.
Assemble the circuit in the enclosure. [Video for details](https://youtu.be/LYbvFizmgOc?si=2Pv3CYcU8y9FNbQ5)

<img src="../../Images/finalCircuit.png" alt="circuit" width="500">

There is a section under the cover where a portable battery can be placed. This choice allows the system to be used without a PC or electrical outlet.

## System Testing 🔬
A system test is available here.

## Physical Error Evaluation 📊
After multiple tests, the maximum number of attempts to calculate physical error in delay was found to be 4. In most cases, no more than 3 attempts were needed.
This error arises from the way Arduino measures time: its ceramic chip is sensitive to temperature changes, causing slight precision fluctuations.
A possible solution could be the use of dedicated timer modules, less affected by temperature.
Also, consider the possible delay of optocouplers and connections.
